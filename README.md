# Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates a machine learning-based approach for predicting stock prices using historical data. The project is implemented using Python and popular ML libraries.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Data collection using Yahoo Finance
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Machine learning model training (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
- Model evaluation and prediction
- Visualization of predicted vs actual stock prices

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- yfinance

## ðŸš€ Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git
    cd stock-price-prediction
    ```

2. Install required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## ðŸ“‚ Files Description

- `Stock_Price_Prediction_Using_Machine_Learning_ipynb.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation.
- `README.md`: Project documentation and setup instructions.
- `requirements.txt`: Required Python packages.

## ðŸ§ª How to Run

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Open the `.ipynb` file and run cells step-by-step.
3. Modify the stock ticker in the notebook to analyze different stocks.

## ðŸ“ˆ Sample Results

- Plots showing predicted vs actual prices.
- Accuracy metrics such as RMSE or RÂ² for model performance.

## ðŸ”® Future Scope

- Integrate deep learning models like LSTM.
- Use more features (technical indicators, sentiment analysis).
- Develop a web app using Streamlit or Flask.
